For the design of my website I used midjurney, after tiping prompts I recived couple options for my project.

</div>

Couple changes to the prompt, couple rerolls, checking of different variants I finally got what I liked, and though that will be ideal for this project.

When I had my design and logo ready, it was time go gather some content for my website. For that I used ChatGPT, I asked what kind of sections I need on my website and write content or each sections. 

<br>

When I finally had everything I needed I was time to start coding. And after one week of coding I develop this full responsive website.
     
<div align="center">                                                                                                                                                
  <a href="https://mateuszsojkacode.github.io/Everyday/" align="center" width="100%">Everyday</a>  
</div>       
<div align="center">

</div>

<br>

And I must say that I am satisfied with the end result. There were some difficulties during the process, but nothing serious that I would not be unable to solve with help of google. There also some parts that could work a bit better, there is a room to make some small adjustments. Propably in the nearest future I will come back to this project a fix those small issues that bother me.

Features included:
  - fully responsive
  - animated cards
  - slider
  - dropdown list
