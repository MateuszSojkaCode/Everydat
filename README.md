When I had design and logo, now I only had to create content for my website and for that I used another AI tool ChatGPT. My whole "conversation" with ChatGPT you can fin in file Tsunami.docx

And now when I had everything I need I started to write the code. After couple days of coding this is the end result.
     
<div align="center">                                                                                                                                                
  <a href="https://mateuszsojkacode.github.io/Everyday/" align="center" width="100%">Tsunami</a>
</div>          
                                                                                          
<br>
                                                                                          
I must say that I happy with the result, Finaly I have some content to use on the website, not Lorem Ipsum all the time. But yes I am aware that there I some things that could be done different. Some parts of website should work as they should do. Yes FAQ I am talking to you.
                                                                           
Maybe in couple days I will back to this project I fix all the issues I have with it. But now I am going to leave it and jump to anothe project that is waiting for me.
